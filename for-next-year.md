# Amy's things to change

- more time explaining population mean
- clarify continuous random variables: pdf and cdf 
- diagram for complements 0|1,2,3,4,5
- more worked examples
- normal distribution: why log transform?
- Do exercises together
- before: binomial trials, introduce "custom" random variables, define mean, define variance; then introduce "named" distributions
